🧠 LLM Chatbot for Course & Event Q&A

This project explores the design, evaluation, and implementation of a chatbot powered by large language models to answer domain-specific questions. The chatbot was tested in two settings: university course information and the Robofest event. The project compared different approaches (free/premium models, fine-tuning, RAG) and produced a working prototype.

🛠️ My Role & Contributions

Collected and prepared domain data (course catalog, event info).

Designed training datasets for fine-tuning and RAG approaches.

Evaluated chatbot responses using relevance, clarity, and accuracy metrics.

Built a prototype front-end for users to interact with the chatbot.

Designed and presented two posters summarizing results.

🚀 Approaches & Technologies Used

Free & Premium LLMs: Baseline testing with ChatGPT models.

Fine-Tuning: Trained domain-specific models using JSONL data.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Combined embedding-based retrieval with generation for more accurate answers.

Evaluation Metrics: Scored outputs for quality and clarity.

Prototype: HTML/JS chatbot interface.

📈 Results / Outcomes

Premium ChatGPT achieved the highest scores (~4.9/5 average).

Fine-tuned and RAG models showed promise but had trade-offs.

Fine-tuning: precise, but costly and data-dependent.

RAG: flexible, easier to update with new data.

Event chatbot prototype successfully answered common Robofest questions but highlighted dataset and cost challenges.
