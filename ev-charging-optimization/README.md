‚ö° Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure: A Data-Driven Approach
üîé Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between electric vehicle (EV) adoption and the availability of charging stations across U.S. states. The goal is to identify underserved areas and recommend optimal locations for new charging infrastructure. By optimizing placement, the project aims to improve accessibility, reduce congestion, and encourage broader EV adoption.

üõ†Ô∏è My Role & Contributions

Collected and cleaned state-level data on EV population, charging stations, charging ports, licensed drivers, and gas prices.
Performed multivariate analysis to study correlations between EV numbers and charging infrastructure.
Applied forecasting methods (SES & AES) to predict EV population growth, with MAPE values ranging from 0.010 to 0.077.
Visualized trends with Excel graphs and PowerPoint figures.
Designed and presented a poster summarizing the findings and recommendations.

üöÄ Technologies Used

Languages/Tools: Python, MATLAB, Excel, RStudio
Statistical Methods: Multivariate Analysis, Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES), Adjusted Exponential Smoothing (AES)
Visualization: Excel graphs, PowerPoint poster

üìà Results / Outcomes

Found a strong correlation between EV population and charging infrastructure (EVs, charging stations, and ports were highly correlated).
Identified that gas prices showed weaker correlation with EV growth.
Forecasted California‚Äôs EV population at 1.35 million by June 2024, demonstrating rapid adoption.
Highlighted states such as North Dakota and Alaska as underserved regions with high EV-to-charger ratios.
Final recommendation: Prioritize charger placement in underserved states and high-traffic regions to support future EV adoption.
